This is a version of the game
[Dominion](http://www.riograndegames.com/games.html?id=278/) written in
[Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/). The goal is is to replicate all featueres
of game play, but as of yet, there's not much happening.

This app is tested using [Jamsmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/), so
hopefully everything works.

Right now there's no way to play across the internet. I guess I'll have to take
a look at node.js and socket.io.
